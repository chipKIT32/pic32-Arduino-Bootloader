This is the source code for the stk500v2 bootloader that runs on most any Microchip pic32 part. It currently has been tested on chips with at least 32k of RAM.

The bootloader is compatible with v5.8 of avrdude.

There is some modifications required in order to get the LED to blink for your particular part


The current supported boards are the Digilent uno and mega pic32 boards.

This project is set up for Microchips MPLAB-X compiler environment. It already has support for the uno and mega and the Microchip pic32 starter kit.
